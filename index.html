                    of Representatives to the states based on their population.</p>
                <p>The bureau's various censuses and surveys help allocate over $675 billion in federal funds every year and it helps states, local communities, and businesses make informed decisions.The information provided by the census informs decisions
                    on where to build and maintain schools, hospitals, transportation infrastructure, and police and fire departments.</p>
